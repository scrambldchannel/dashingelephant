summary: During the cold Berlin winter I've been working on a few little things that I felt were worth sharing, even if just as a way to organise my thoughts. I've been working on data integration with tools like Airbyte as well as some dbt modelling. I've also started a few little hobby projects around TM1 tooling and just undertaken my annual attempt to remember how scraping works. Anyway, here's a rundown.
