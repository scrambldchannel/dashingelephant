As part of my new role, I'm renewing my love/hate relationship with TM1. While sweeping out the canyons of my mind, I thought I'd scribble down a prime number's worth of little tricks I've collated over the years. For all the things I like about TM1, there are a lot of issues to workaround as a developer.

This little list might help you work around some of them but, be warned, you might need to put your grey hat on for some of them.

Where the server environment is a consideration, these hacks focus on on premise / Windows for the sole reason that 95% of my lived experience has been in that space.

## #1 - Getting into a model you don't have access to

You know you shouldn't but sometimes you need to get access to a model that someone has forgotten to give you access to,

## #2 - Stopping and Starting instances on Windows without access to the box

## #3 - The old 7zip backup trick

## #4 - Find that unfed cell

I don't know if this one is even really a trick, it's more like "the job".

## #5 - Find that overfeeding problem

A bit like number 4, this isn't really a hack but an essential weapon in your armoury.

## #6 - Take out the trash

Restart your servers once a week (or more). While you're at it, remove all the persistent feeder files

## #7 - Add an a all n elements subset to every dimension

Seriously, you'll thank me later. You can achieve this in a couple of ways but personally I find creating a dynamic subset for each dim is sufficient. I've had people report issues with MDX performance but it seems unlikely that something like the following will cause issues in most use cases.

Is MDX recognised in markdown?

```mdx
blah blah
```

So go ahead and use the MDX macro recorder thing to do this for every dim....

No, really, don't do that. Just run a script to do it.

Python (with TM1py):

Powershell:

While we're at it, I suggest always having a single identifiable consolidation that

## #8 - Use Bedrock

There is prett much no good reason you shouldn't do this in 2022.

## #9 - Create a copy of a model with no/less data

OK, this is a work in progress but here's the idea - say you have a model that consumes 150gb of RAM in prod but you want to run/test/develop it on a less powerful machine like your laptop. Usually you can do so effectively with but a small subset of the data, or even no data at all. Using the TM1py, you can create an empty copy like so:

## #10 - Delete all blb files

Especially the ones for rules (are there any others?). This isn't really a hack, just a safeguard.

## #11 -
