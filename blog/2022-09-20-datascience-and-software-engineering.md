title: Does data science development require a different approach to traditional software engineering?  
date: 2022-09-19
summary: I'm not a data scientist but I have worked on the peripherary of several ML developments. A Twitter discussion, with several people asserting that widely adopted software engineering practices aren't a good fit for data science development. My initial reaction was to disagree but then I thought I'd try to examine my reasoning.

A Twitter discussion, with several people asserting that widely adopted software engineering practices aren't a good fit for data science development. My initial reaction was to disagree but then I thought I'd try to examine my reasoning. 

** Spoiler Alert ** I _still_ disagree, with some caveats, but I can also see why people feel the way that they do.

Here's the tweet I initially landed upon:
