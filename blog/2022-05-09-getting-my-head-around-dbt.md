DBT has gained huge traction in recent times and while I've flirted with it before, I'm finally getting stuck into it and wanted to write down some insights gleaned from doing my first PR review. Docs, tutorials and youtube videos are all great but I really feel I start to learn things when sitting down and fiddling around with the code in an editor. I was sent a PR recently to look at which was a perfect intro because it added a new data source and built a simple model end to end.

Anatomy of a project repo?

So what is a model? A model in dbt is a select statement.

Where does DBT cloud fit in? 

Paths look a bit screwy to me but maybe I'm something...

What is this incremental filter thing?
